Version 1.1 is tested, working, beautiful. 

Please contribute to the project by sharing your code. 

Toastduino has I/O pins for connecting LCD screens, rotary encoders, toggle switches, pushbuttons, and analog inputs.

Pin D2 has an interrupt feature making it perfect for rotary encoders and pushbuttons. 

A total of 8 precision K-type thermocouple inputs; wow.

Toastduino can make for some really nice kitchen equipment! Let's go cullinary engineers.
